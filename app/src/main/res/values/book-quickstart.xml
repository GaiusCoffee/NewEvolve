                In order to play Lorekeeper, this app alone is not enough! You\'d also need the
                following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least <b>four six-sided dice</b>, preferably four dice per person playing.</li>
                <li>From <b>one to four other friends</b>, all with this application installed in their
                smartphone. One of you would be the Lorekeeper, and the others would be the
                adventurers</li>
                <li><b>Pen, paper and props</b> are optional, but greatly improves how Lorekeeper is
                played.</li>
            </ul>
